# Timescale analysis of time-dependent observables
The timescale analysis is a flexible data-driven analysis to reveal the strength and position in time of dynamics of a studied system.
It performs a multi-exponential fit to any observable, with non-zero amplitudes corresponding to relevant dynamics.
While this module can be used for any observable, it was design with multiple protein distances in mind.
Therefore, a "dynamical content" is defined which combines the amplitudes of each observable into a single time-resolved observable.
For more detailed information about the method, see [1](https://doi.org/10.1366/000370206776593654), [2](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0187) and [3](https://doi.org/10.6094/UNIFR/266874).
